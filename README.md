- 👋 Hi~, I’m @bisakaniwa!
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about how our machines work! I'm still exploring though.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, React with Javascript and Typescript. I can do a thing or two using Angular too. Also, I'm formally studying computer sciences.
- ⚡ I'm graduated in Philosophy and I've learned lots of formal logics there :)
- 💞️ I dream on having profound knowledge on AI and machine learning so we can talk about ethics ;) (philosophers, right?)
- 📫 How to reach me: same @ on Instagram, I'm at LinkedIn as Bianca Sakaniwa and you can e-mail me too!
